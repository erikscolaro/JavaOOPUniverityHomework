# Java OOP University Homework

This repository contains multiple Java projects completed as part of Object-Oriented Programming university coursework. Each project demonstrates various OOP concepts, design patterns, and Java features.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate projects, each in its own folder:

- **lab4-huts-main**: Mountain huts management system that tracks information about municipalities and mountain huts in different regions
- **lab6-social-main**: Social network application with features for user management, friendships, groups, posts, and statistics
- **exam-20240703-emergencyroom-main**: Emergency room management system with patient reception, specialist assignment, and department management

## Projects Overview

Each project follows a similar structure:
- `src/` - Source code organized by packages
- `test/` - JUnit test cases
- `README.md` - Project requirements and specifications
- `pom.xml` - Maven project configuration

## Java and JUnit Topics Covered

### Java Concepts
- Object-oriented design (classes, interfaces, inheritance)
- Exception handling (custom exceptions)
- Collections framework (HashMap, ArrayList, Map, List)
- Stream API and functional programming
- File I/O operations
- Java Date/Time API
- Encapsulation and information hiding
- Comparators and sorting
- Method overloading
- JavaDoc documentation

### Design Patterns
- Facade pattern (e.g., Region class in Mountain Huts project)
- Data Access Objects (DAO)
- Model-View-Controller concepts

### JUnit Testing
- Unit test organization
- Assertions (assertEquals, assertNotNull)
- Test fixtures (@Before setup)
- Exception testing
- Test resource management
- Custom assertions for collections

### Build Tools
- Maven project management
- Project dependencies
- Test execution configuration using maven-surefire-plugin
- Code coverage with JaCoCo

Each project builds upon previous concepts while introducing new programming techniques and challenges.
